-- A very simple command line visualizer program for the SHA-1 cryptographic hash function
Simply download, save both .py files in the same directory, and run from terminal and follow user prompts
I created this while doing my best to fully understand what is going on in this first version of the Secure Hashing Algorithm hash functions.
It certainly helped me to understand everything, hopefully somebody else can get some value from this. 

Thank you,
